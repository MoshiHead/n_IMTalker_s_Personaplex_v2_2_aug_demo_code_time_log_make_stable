"""latency_logger.py — a dedicated, self-contained timing/latency log for the
live PersonaPlex + IMTalker pipeline.

Why a separate file at all: `conversation_logger.py` answers "what happened and
why"; this answers "where did the seconds go". Mixing the two made per-stage
timings impossible to read -- the timing lines were scattered between
transcripts, search results and narrative paragraphs, and the only end-to-end
number available was `turn_done`, which stops at the moment the grounding text
was injected, i.e. BEFORE the model had said a single word.

Two files per server run, both append-only:

  1. `latency_<session>.log`  -- human-readable. A live line per stage as it
     completes, then one self-contained block per turn: a timeline of when each
     component finished (as an offset from the moment the user stopped
     speaking), the stage durations sorted slowest-first, the token counts
     (including how many tokens the compressor produced), and the headline
     question->first word / question->finished answer latencies.
  2. `latency_<session>.jsonl` -- one JSON object per finished turn, with every
     stage, mark, counter and headline metric as a flat field, for plotting or
     regression-checking a change against a previous run.

Everything here is best-effort: a logging failure must never break the live
pipeline, so every public method swallows its own exceptions. Thread-safety:
`start_turn`/`mark`/`stage`/`count` are called from both the GPU thread and the
background routing/search thread, so all state mutation and file I/O happens
under one lock.
